## Angularjs / VIVO Widgets Example

A start to using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to create a site
from the JSONP feeds from [VIVO
Widgets](https://github.com/OIT-ADS-Web/vivo_widgets).

## Get Started

You must have node installed and then run.

    $ npm install

Once you have done that install, you need to install the bower
dependencies by running:

    $ bower install

After running that, you should be able to run the build in server:

    $ grunt server

This might automatically open your browser, but if not, navigate to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).

You could build a static optimized version by doing:

    $ grunt build

This will create a static build in ```dist``` directory.
